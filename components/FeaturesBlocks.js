              <p className="text-center text-gray-600">
                Of course. Philosophers often use the first person when mapping
                out their argument. This is not to say that the essay should be
                informal; it should be formal â€“ this means no contractions!

                No. The questions serve as pointers to help you consider the
                philosophical implications of each topic, but you do not need to
                answer all of them. Feel free to create your own question so
                long as it is relevant to the prompt.

                Your paper will undergo multiple rounds of blind review, where
                it will be evaluated by at least two different adjudicators.

                A panel of university philosophy faculty, graduate students, and
                international debate coaches will be adjudicating your
                submission to determine if it fulfills the criteria for
                acceptance into the journal. For the criteria, refer to the
                rubric.
